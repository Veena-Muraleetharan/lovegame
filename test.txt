SAM | 01-19-2017 | 07:45 | Hey Alex!
ALEX | 01-19-2017 | 07:48 | Hey cutie. What's up?
ALEX | 01-19-2017 | 07:49 | I just woke up. It's beautiful outside today.
SAM | 01-19-2017 | 08:30 | I was just thinking about you. :)
SAM | 01-19-2017 | 08:35 | Is your day going well?
ALEX | 01-19-2017 | 08:50 | Yes. I am excited to come home and hang out with you.
SAM | 01-19-2017 | 09:30 | Um... :/ I don't think we can hang out.
SAM 01-19-2017  09:31 This is awkward, because I said we would. But I am so busy.
ALEX 01-19-2017 09:50 Oh no! What happened? I hope everything is okay. I have been enjoying my vacation so much I forgot to think about what plans you might have when I get back. It's been weird not being in school, and I miss you. Hopefully we can hang out another time when you're not as busy? :)
SAM 01-19-2017  12:40 Haha sure
ALEX 01-19-2017 12:41 Great! Like, when?
SAM 01-19-2017  12:59 Maybe we can make these plans later lol
ALEX 01-19-2017 13:22 Like when? How about we talk on the phone tonight and figure things out? That would be great if we could :D
ALEX 01-19-2017 14:22 U there?
ALEX 01-19-2017 14:35 Are you mad at me?
ALEX 01-19-2017 15:22 Hello? :(
